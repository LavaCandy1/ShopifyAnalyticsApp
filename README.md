### Prerequisites

    The frontend needs to know where the backend API is running.

    - In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env`.

    - Add this in the file and add URL to point to your running backend server, or if you dont have a backend you can use mine hosted [here](https://storedataapi-production.up.railway.app/api)

    ```env
    # The base URL of your Spring Boot backend API
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend:**
    For the frontend to work, your **Spring Boot backend application must be running**.
